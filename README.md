Repository contains 3 .cpp files containing 3 sorting algorithms,
with O(n^2) time complexity. The algorithms are:
- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort

The *run.py* file contains a short script that compiles and
runs the .cpp files.

The algorithms were implemented to match the visual representation
[here](https://visualgo.net/en/sorting).
